Comprehensive and easy-to-use parameter file saver for Python 3. Essentially,
I am tired of having to create an interface to generate parameter files for
multiple runs on different machines. Essentially, it is easier and more
rigorous to generate a separate input file for each run that is, say, submitted
to a different core or different machine. This project aims at being a
comprehensive (and idiot-proof, else I wouldn't be able to use it) solution
to this problem.
